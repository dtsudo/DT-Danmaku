DT Danmaku is a game written as a proof-of-concept for getting all the basic parts of a game working (e.g. rendering objects on the screen, adding audio, managing frame rate, etc).

How to execute the program:

	Run "DT Danmaku.exe".

Licensing:

	The source code of DT Danmaku (the contents under the "Source code" folder) is licensed under the MIT license.  However, note that it uses dependencies and other assets that are licensed under different licenses.

	The code uses the AgateLib library for rendering graphics.  Agatelib is licensed under the Mozilla Public License version 1.1.  See https://github.com/eylvisaker/AgateLib for more details about the AgateLib library.  The AgateLib source code is located under /Dependencies/AgateLib.
	
	The code also uses SDL, which is licensed under the LGPL.
	
	The font used in the images was generated by metaflop.  (See http://www.metaflop.com/modulator for more details about metaflop.)  As the website notes: "All outline-based fonts (webfonts or otf) that are generated with this project are licensed under the SIL Open Font License v1.1 (OFL). This means that you can freely use and extend the fonts and also use them commercially. Any derivative work has to be made freely available under the same license."
	
	The game uses images and sounds from Kenney Asset Pack.  These images are licensed under Creative Commons Zero (CC0). See www.kenney.nl for more details.

Files and folder structure:

	In the root folder, we have "DT Danmaku.exe", which is the actual executable.  This readme file ("readme.txt") and a copy of the MIT license ("MIT license.txt") are also present.
	
	There are also several libraries used by "DT Danmaku.exe":
	* AgateLib.dll
	* AgateLib.WinForms.dll
	* AgateLib.WinForms.xml
	* AgateLib.xml
	* AgateOTK.dll
	* AgateSDL.dll
	* DTDanmakuLib.dll
	* DTLib.dll
	* libogg-0.dll
	* libvorbis-0.dll
	* libvorbisfile-3.dll
	* OpenTK.dll
	* OpenTK.Utilities.dll
	* OpenTK.Utilities.xml
	* OpenTK.xml
	* SDL.dll
	* SDL_mixer.dll
	* Tao.Sdl.dll
	* Tao.Sdl.xml
	
	In the "Data" folder, there are two folders: "Images" and "Audio".  The "Images" folder contains the images used by the program.  The "Audio" folder contains the audio files used by the program.
	
	The "Source code" folder contains the source code.
	
	The "Dependencies" folder contains the third-party libraries used; in this case, this is just AgateLib.

How to compile the source code:

	The source code is divided into several distinct parts:
	*	DTLib
	*	DTDanmakuLib
	*	DTDanmaku
		
	The "/Source code/DTLib" folder contains some basic code for common operations (e.g. handling keyboard/mouse inputs, rendering images to the screen).  Note that these files are generic and do not contain any specific game logic.  Compile these files:
	
		csc /target:library /out:DTLib.dll ".\Source code\DTLib\*.cs"
	
	The "/Source code/DTDanmakuLib" folder contains the core game logic code.  It uses DTLib.dll as a dependency.  Compile these files:
	
		csc /target:library /out:DTDanmakuLib.dll /reference:DTLib.dll ".\Source code\DTDanmakuLib\*.cs"
	
	Finally, the "/Source code/DTDanmaku" folder contains the code that uses AgateLib, along with DTDanmakuLib, to implement the actual program.  Compile these files:
	
		csc /target:winexe /out:"DT Danmaku.exe" /reference:DTLib.dll /reference:DTDanmakuLib.dll /reference:AgateLib.dll /platform:anycpu32bitpreferred ".\Source code\DTDanmaku\*.cs"
	
	Note that AgateLib requires several files in order to work; ensure that the following files are also present:
	* AgateLib.dll
	* AgateLib.WinForms.dll
	* AgateLib.WinForms.xml
	* AgateLib.xml
	* AgateOTK.dll
	* AgateSDL.dll
	* libogg-0.dll
	* libvorbis-0.dll
	* libvorbisfile-3.dll
	* OpenTK.dll
	* OpenTK.Utilities.dll
	* OpenTK.Utilities.xml
	* OpenTK.xml
	* SDL.dll
	* SDL_mixer.dll
	* Tao.Sdl.dll
	* Tao.Sdl.xml
